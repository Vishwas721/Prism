To complete our review, we require the following additional documentation:\n\n- Recent X-ray imaging of the affected knee (within 90 days)\n\nThis will help us rule out fracture and ensure MRI is the appropriate next step. Please submit these documents within 48 hours to avoid delays.\n\nThank you,\nPrism Medical Review Team",
